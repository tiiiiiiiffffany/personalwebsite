                <p>NTU's institutional predecessor was Taihoku Imperial University, founded in 1928 by the Japanese colonial administration. The first president was Shidehara Tan Tairaka Hiroshi. In 1945, the Republic of China won the war of resistance against
                    Japan, and Taiwan was handed over to the Nationalist government of China. On November 15 of that year, Taihoku Imperial University was formally transferred to Chinese administration and renamed as National Taiwan University, with Dr.
                    Tsung-lo Lo appointed as the first President. During the Japanese occupation, the University consisted of two academic divisions: the Literature and Politics division and the Science and Agriculture division, with about 60 students
                    enrolled each semester. The Medical division was added in 1936, followed by the Engineering division in 1943. Additionally, the University included the affiliated Agriculture and Forestry division, the affiliated Medical special division,
                    a Tropical Medicine research institute and a preparatory school. Also, in 1943 the Southern Humanities research institute and the Southern Resource research institute were added. At that time, each division operated according to the
                    lecture system, with a full-time Professor in charge of a faculty of associate professors, lecturers, teaching assistants and staff. These divisions and institutes were financially independent and had their own libraries. By 1945,
                    the university expanded to five divisions, including Literature and Politics, Science, Agriculture, Medicine and Engineering, with a total enrollment of 382 students. After restructuring in accordance with the ROC academic system in
                    1945, academic departments were established and the former divisions were renamed Colleges. The Literature and Politics division was divided into the College of Liberal Arts and the College of Law. Additionally, colleges of Science,
                    Medicine, Engineering and Agriculture were established. Initially, there were six colleges with 22 departments. In 1945, student enrollment was 585. In the following years, the departments and colleges expanded in faculty and hardware
                    in step with growing budgets and rising social expectations. In 1960, the night school was initiated on a trial basis, and in 1967 a new night school was established. In 1987, the College of Management was established, followed by
                    the College of Public Health in 1993 and the College of Electrical Engineering in 1997. The College of Electrical Engineering was later rechristened the College of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering; in 1999, the College of
                    Law was renamed the College of Social Sciences, and the Night Division and the Center for Continuing Education were combined to form the School for Professional and Continuing Studies. In 2002, the College of Agriculture was renamed
                    the College of Bio-resources and Agriculture, and in 2002 a College of Life Sciences was added. Now, the university has 11 colleges, with 54 departments and 108 graduate institutes, plus over 50 national and university-level research
                    centers. The total number of students, including those enrolled at the School of Professional and Continuing Studies, has grown to over 32,000, including over 17,000 university students and 15,000 graduate students. Now, the number
                    of graduate students at NTU almost equals the number of university students, which indicates that NTU has successfully been transformed into a research university.<br><em>from: https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/</em></p>

                    <p>National Taiwan University, formerly known as Taipei Imperial University during the Japanese colonial era, was founded in 1945 after the island’s sovereignty had been transferred to the Republic of China government. The Department
                        of Political Science was established two years later in 1947 under the supervision of the Faculty of Law. In 1963, the department underwent its first departmental reform— dividing itself into three sub-divisions: political theory,
                        international relations, and public administration. Each of the sub-divisions recruited students separately, and over five thousand students have received their degrees from the department up to now. In February of 1957, the Department
                        of Political Science expanded once again— adding a graduate program offering master’s degrees in political theory, international relations, and public administration. In 1976, nineteen years after the second departmental reform,
                        the department created a doctoral program, accepting students who are keen to pursue an academic career in political science. In 2001, the department established a program granting an Executive Masters of Public Administration.
                        Its aim is to give high-level professionals in the public and private sectors an opportunity to further their academic pursuits, and to promote linkages between theory and practice.<br> <em>from: http://politics.ntu.edu.tw/english/</em></p>

                    <h4 id="list-item-2"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the Department</h4>
                    <p>A proposal was made in 1957 to establish the Department of Library Science, and after five years of discussions, the Departmentwas officially established on June 20, 1961. In the beginning, the mission of the department was to cultivate
                        professional talents for libraries, and later on the department started to actively promote the research of library science, the development of libraries and the further development of professional practice in the field of library
                        and information science. Master’s and PhD programs were established at the department in 1980 and 1989 respectively, turning the department into the first institute of library science in Taiwan with all three programs, and it continued
                        to cultivate professional talents in this field. In its first year, the department took 25 students. Currently the department admits more than 60 students each year and has over 2000 graduates.<br><br> The rapid development of
                        information technology and the coming of the internet age have diversified people’s demand for information as well as the ways of obtaining information. Besides basic library science, the Department of Library Science has expanded
                        the scope of its education and research to include information science, educational technology, knowledge management and other related fields. For the sake of keeping up with current trends in the modern world, the department officially
                        changed its name to the Department and Graduate Institute of Library and Information Science (DGILIS) in 1998 and continued its mission of cultivating talents for libraries and various information service organizations. In order
                        to increase the number of avenues for librarians to receive of on-the-job training so that there can be more mid to high level managers in various libraries, thus improving the management in said libraries, DGILIS established the
                        “Continuing Master’s Program” during the 2003 academic year. In the 2009 academic year, the continuing master’s program was integrated into the department’s master’s program.<br><br> In order to facilitate teaching and research,
                        DGILIS has a rich collection of books as well as modern teaching and A/V equipment. It also equipped with a human-computer-interaction lab, a multimedia A/V center, a department internship library, and a computer lab, making it
                        the most optimal learning environment for library and information science students in Taiwan. The research and education in this department emphasize information content and information service. This department also plays an important
                        role in the development of government information policies.<br><br> In order to assist the government in building information infrastructure, the future development of DGILIS lies in collecting, organizing and analyzing information,
                        sorting and researching human information behavior, planning and designing information service systems, disseminating information resources, providing information services, etc. This will hopefully allow us to integrate information
                        and technology and to achieve our educational goals.<br><br> At the same time, DGILIS faculty keep up with the trends in the information society and conduct cutting-edge information research that is both interdisciplinary and integrated
                        with technology. DGILIS faculty research is not limited within the field of library and information science; they also conduct collaborative research typically involves scholars in computer engineering, information management,
                        communication technologies, and many other fields. The department has also continued to strengthen cooperative relations with the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, the Department of Information Management,
                        the Department of Business Administration and the Department of Bio-Industry Communication and Development in order to jointly establish inter-disciplinary programs on knowledge management, creative business start-up, and communications,
                        and to cultivate the diverse talents needed in today’s information society.<br> <em>from: https://www.lis.ntu.edu.tw/english/?page_id=37</em></p>
